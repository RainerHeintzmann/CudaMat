      <p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">CudaMat enables
        fast computing on graphics cards that supports the <a
          href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">CUDA
          programming language</a>. Currently such cards are available
        from NVidia. CudaMat is, as much as possible, invisible to the
        user. The idea is that the user can transform any existing
        Matlab code into a CudaMat code with minimal effort. E.g. with a
        single line like<i> a=cuda(a)</i> the Matlab object <span
          style="font-style: italic;">'a</span>' gets transformed into a
        CudaMat object <span style="font-style: italic;">'a</span>'.
        This can be checked using the matlab command <span
          style="font-style: italic;">whos</span>.</p>
      <h2>Under which conditions will CudaMat be fast?</h2>
      CudaMat will greately improve the speed of your code, when the
      main time of your Matlab code is spent in computing 'expensive'
      operations between large matrices and/or vectors, sums over them
      or Fourier transformations. However, when the problem consists of
      many operations on small matrices and vectors, CudaMat will
      probably not help you and might in fact turn out to be slower than
      standard matlab code. One way to think of this is that every start
      of a function execution in CudaMat has some overhead, but once it
      is running, it is quite fast.<br>
      It may be possible to adjust the performance a little bit by
      changing the two <span style="font-style: italic;">#define</span>
      commands for <span style="font-style: italic;">BLOCKSIZE</span>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;">CUIMAGE_REDUCE_THREADS</span>&nbsp;


















      given at the top of the file <span style="font-style: italic;">cudaArith.cu</span>.<br>
      <h2>Is there a demo to quickly check the performance increase?</h2>
      Yes. CudaMat comes with a two test programs '<span
        style="font-style: italic;">applemantest.m</span>' and&nbsp; '<span
        style="font-style: italic;">speedtestDeconv.m</span>'.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
        applemantest.m</span> calculates the famous Mandelbrot set in a
      straight forward way. This test has the advantage that it does not
      require any toolboxes other than <a
        href="http://www.nanoimaging.de/CudaMat/">CudaMat</a> and <a
        href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html">NVidia's cuda
        library</a> to be installed. The speedup optained depend on the
      chosen datasize. On my Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU @ 2,8 GHz, 64 bit
      processor, Windows 7 is about a factor of 30 (2.35 versus 75,5
      seconds) for a 2048x2048 image with iteration depth 300.<br>
      The new (as of version 1.0.0.06 beta) on-the-fly compilation
      allows a further speedup by writing code snippets for the GPU. In
      this case the graphic card needs 0.088 second for the example
      above, yielding <span style="font-weight: bold;">a total speedup
        bigger than 850</span>! Type "edit applemantest" under matlab to
      get an example how to achieve such speed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">speedtestDeconv.m</span>

      microscopy dataset (using the DipImage '<span style="font-style:

      To run this demo, <a href="http://www.diplib.org">DipImage</a>

        href="http://www.nanoimaging.de/CudaMat/">CudaMat</a> need to be

      card gave about 10x speedup (3.3 versus 30.3 seconds) in
      comparison to a 2,4 GHz AMD Hammer 64 bit processor and gcc 4.3.2
      run under OpenSuse11.1 .<br>
      <h2>What is CUDA?</h2>
      Cuda is a programming language extension to C which enables code
      to run in parallel on multi-processor graphics cards. Current
      graphics cards can have more than 200 processors running
      simultaneously. They all execute the same code (SIMD = single
      instruction, multiple data). If a branch point (e.g. initiated by
      an '<span style="font-style: italic;">if</span>') is reached,
      where some processors have to execute different code than others,
      these processes are temporarily suspended. The beauty of the
      hardware is that this switching between many thousands of
      processes is very efficient.<br>
      <h2>What changes may be necessary to existing Matlab code to run
        under CudaMat?</h2>
      Note that CudaMat currently only supports the <span
        style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">single</span>
      floatingpoint <span style="font-weight: bold;">datatype</span> of
      matlab (4 bytes). Since Matlab usually computed with doubles, the
      results can differ depending on how sensitive the algorithm is to
      roud-off errors.<br>
      The general idea is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">only
        large marix (image) input objects </span>requiring time
      intensive conputations should converted to cuda before the
      existing Matlab code is run. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ideally

















        no changes to the Matlab code should be necessary.</span><br>
      However, practically minor changes can be necessary, if CudaMat
      does not support the operation used in the Matlab code. This is
      especially the case for <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Additional datatypes defined by the Matlab code</li>
        <li>Using a standard Matlab operation that is not yet
          implemented in CudaMat</li>
        <li>If the Matlab code checks for the datatype with operations
          other than isreal() or isfloat(). E.g. if the operation isa()
          is used, the result is probably wrong.</li>
        <li>for loops iterating over the contense of a vector need a
          minor change (iterating over an access index and the assigning
          the component by indexing in the vector) to be compatible with
          CudaMat<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Sometimes the system may perform an automatic conversion to a
      Matlab object, with the associated overhead involved in
      transferring from the graphics card.<br>
      In other cases the user will have to either force this conversion
      (e.g. using <span style="font-style: italic;">single_force(a)</span>),


















      find an alternative expression, which is supported in CudaMat or
      extend the CudaMat algorithms to support this additional feature
      (please send me an email with the new code, so I can put it up on
      the website). <br>
      <br>
      In addition, there may be changes necessary inside the Matlab
      code, if new objects are generated, as these will be by default
      Matlab matrices.<br>
      Prominent examples are the Matlab commands <span
        style="font-style: italic;">zeros() </span>and <span
        style="font-style: italic;">ones() </span>, which by default
      generate Matlab objects. These function calls should be changed to<span
        style="font-style: italic;"> zeros_cuda()</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">ones_cuda()</span>.<br>
      Global variables influencing the behaviour of <span
        style="font-style: italic;">zeros_cuda()</span>, <span
        style="font-style: italic;">ones_cuda()</span> but also
      overloaded DIPImage funcitons<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span
        style="font-style: italic;">newim(), </span><span
        style="font-style: italic;">xx(), yy(), zz(), </span>rr(),
      phiphi(). <br>
      Whether they then generate a standard or a <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cuda</span> object) can conveniently
      be set via the functions <span style="font-style: italic;">set_ones_cuda(state)</span>
      and <span style="font-style: italic;">set_zeros_cuda(state) and
        alike</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Other command which generate Matlab objects are enumerations such
      as <span style="font-style: italic;">[1:N]</span> or <span
        style="font-style: italic;">meshgrid()</span>.<br>
      In future versions, it will be possible to define by a set of
      global variables whether these functions should generate standard
      Matlab objects of cuda objects.<br>
      In addition it may (in rare cases) be necessary to convert
      standard Matlab matrices to cuda (e.g. using the command <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cuda(a)</span>) within the Matlab
      code to run, as some CudaMat functions may not yet automatically
      do so.<br>
      <h2>Why a separate datatype 'cuda'?</h2>
      <br>
      To realize the idea of accessing the speed of the graphics cards
      from within the convenient programming environment of Matlab
      efficiently, one has to avoid memory transfer to and from the
      graphics card as much as possible. To this aim a datatype 'cuda'
      was introduced. <br>
      Whenever matlab needs to execute a function that involves a cuda
      object as one of it’s arguments, it checks for the presence of
      this function in the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">@cuda

















      </span>and executes the code given there. In this way it is
      ensured that code can efficiently be executed on the graphics
      card, without the cuda objects leaving the card.<br>
      <h2>When will transfers be made to and from the graphics card?</h2>
      <br>
      If a cuda object is created (e.g.<span style="font-style: italic;">
        a=cuda(a)</span>), the matlab object is transferred to the
      graphics card. This costs some time and should thus ideally not be
      performed within the inner loop of a calculation. With every
      output operation (e.g. printing the values on the screen or
      displaying an image) the data is transferred back from the
      graphics card to Matlab. <br>
      The commands <span style="font-style: italic;">double_force(a) </span>and


















      <span style="font-style: italic;">single_force(a) </span>will
      force a conversion from a cuda object back to matlab (and not
      affect the object if it is already a standard matlab double or
      single).<br>
      In the event that a CudaMat operation results in a single value,
      the result will automatically transferred back to an ordinary
      Matlab object.<br>
      <br>
      Why do ordinary conversion operations '<span style="font-style:
        italic;">single(a)</span>' and 'double(a)' not convert back to a
      Matlab matrix?<br>
      Currently these operations leave the objects on the graphics card,
      with the aim to require as little modification as possible to
      existing Matlab programs to be able to run under CudaMat.
      Currently these command are essentially ignored. To force a
      conversion use the command <span style="font-style: italic;">single_force(a)

















      </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">double_force(a) </span>with

















      a cuda object 'a'.<br>
      <h2>How can I reset the graphics card when something went wrong?</h2>
      <br>
      If an error appeared during the execution of code on the graphics
      card, it is possible that cuda is in a state, where it needs a
      reset. In this case the first thing to try is the matlab command '<span
        style="font-style: italic;">clear classes</span>', which will
      reload the cuda class and force cuda to initialize on the next
      cuda call. If this does not work, one will have to quite Matlab
      and restart it.<br>
      <h2>Supported Datatypes</h2>
      <br>
      Currently only the datatypes single and single complex are fully
      supported by CudaMat. This means that in the current version all
      computations in double are simply performed at single precision.
      This results in a loss in precisions, which is sometimes not
      acceptable in an application. Future versions will support more
      datatypes (e.g. int datatypes). Currently the cuda libraries (and
      in part the hardware) often also just supports single precision
      computations.<br>
      <h2>How can I change the behaviour of certain operations in
        CudaMat?</h2>
      <br>
      Currently there are very few possibilities to influence the
      behaviour of CudaMat. However, it is planned that the following
      can be influenced by global environment variables in the future:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>adjusting (optimizing) the threading parameters for the cuda
          code, by entering the number of processors that the code
          should assume. Also other optimisation parameters can be set.</li>
        <li>Defining whether the commands <span style="font-style:
            italic;">double()</span> and <span style="font-style:
            italic;">single()</span> will convert cuda objects back to
          Matlab objects or not.</li>
        <li>Defining the behaviour subasgn should be executed (optimized
          or compatible)</li>
        <li>Control whether warning should be printed when automatic
          conversions to cuda objects are performed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Interfacing with DipImage</h2>
      <br>
      CudaMat is designed to be compatible with standard Matlab objects
      as well as objects of the dipimage datatyp. This does not mean
      that DipImage needs to be installed. If no version of DipImage is
      installed, all objects are simply of Matlab origin (<span
        style="font-style: italic;">object.fromDip=false</span>).<br>
      DipImage is an image processing toolbox from Delft university (see<a
        href="http://www.diplib.org"> www.diplib.org</a>) which can be
      obtained free of charge for the academic community.<br>
      This compatibility could be achieved by having the datatype cuda
      remember where each object came from using a tag 'fromDip' within
      each object. However, currently only very basic operations of
      DipImage are supported within CudaMat.<br>
      <h2>Known incompatibilities</h2>
      <br>
      Matlab subassign operations such as '<span style="font-style:
        italic;">b=a;a(3:5,7:10)=10</span>' would change the variable b
      in the current version. The reason for this is that by simply
      changing the object 'a' the code currently avoids an extra copy
      and delete operation as it simply performs the subassign. However,
      if another identical copy of the object exists this object '<span
        style="font-style: italic;">b</span>' will be modified too
      (contrary to standard Matlab code), as Matlab is tricked in
      avoiding the extra copy operation.<br>
      <h2>Additional CudaMat operations not present in standard Matlab</h2>
      <br>
      Many of the dipimage operations are implemented also for the cuda
      datatype when imported from a standard matlab object.<br>
      E.g. ft and ift perform fft and fft shift operations<br>
      <br>
      <h2>The really big speedup: Implementing your own Cuda function</h2>
      If you type<br>
      edit applemantest.m<br>
      and look at the code, you get an idea, about how to really speed
      up the code. The essential bit is to write a small pice of C-style
      code which is automatically wrapped up by CudaMat into its own
      function that can then be called. This is possible for a number of
      standard functions.<br>
      The two essential commands which do the magic are:<br>
      "cuda_define" and "cuda_compile_all". The former defines a new
      cuda function with its own name and a program code as given by a
      string. Then many such definitions can be collected and finally
      the cuda_compile_all command wraps them all up in the correct ways
      and compiles them such that they can be called from within matlab
      simply by their given name.<br>
      However, the programming of such new functions has to observ
      certain rule as described in the <a
        href="on-the-fly-programming-guide.html">on-the-fly-programming-guide</a>.<br>
      <h2>Known errors / incompatibilies<br>
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>sum, min and max for arrays always sum over all elements in
          CudaMat. This has to be changed to be compatible with standard
          Matlab code (partial sums) and the possibility in DipImage to
          sum over arbitrary dimensions.</li>
        <li>for loops assigning vectors do not work (e.g. :&nbsp; <span
            style="font-style: italic;">for q=cuda([1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2
            1]);fprintf('Hello Wold\n');end</span>&nbsp; would not
          produce the same result as standard matlab code)<br>
        </li>
        <li>as CudaMat works always with floating point datatypes,
          certain kind of operations (integer division) and overflow
          errors (e.g. for byte datatype in dipimage) are not supported.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The internal structure of CudaMat</h2>
      <br>
      CudaMat is based on the cuda datatype. All the methods operating
      on this datatype are stored in the <span style="font-style:
        italic;">@cuda </span>folder and other methods (which also do
      something for other datatypes) are stored outside in the main
      CudaMat folder.<br>
      A cuda object stores a reference (<span style="font-style:
        italic;">myobject.ref</span>) and the information whether it
      should be treated according to Matlab or DipImage conventions (<span
        style="font-style: italic;">myobject.fromDIP</span>). The cuda
      functions are either taken direction from the Cuda fft and CuBlas
      libraries or are written in CUDA (all in the file <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cudaArith.cu</span>). The mex file <span
        style="font-style: italic;">cuda_cuda.c</span> is a frontend to
      cuda which supports all the functionalilty. The main mex function
      in this file is invoked always with a command string, telling it
      which command to execute. At the moment this sting is parsed
      simply by a daisy chain of strcmp operations. As the number of
      commands has grown, this might eventually present an unacceptable
      overhead, but I believe at the moment it should still not pose a
      problem.<br>
      This interface should make it comparably easy to adapt the code
      for working under Octave, Mathematica or in fact any other
      interpreter driven language.<br>

          style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14pt; font-family:
          'Arial';">How to obtain</span></h2>
      <p style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0in;
        margin-right: 0in;" dir="ltr">Download <a href="CudaMat.zip">the


















          current version</a> as a tar-gzip-file with all the necessary
        classes and an example html-file in it. Just place the CudaMat
        folder somewhere, add it to the Matlab path and call initCuda
        (see installation details below). Depending on the operation
        system it may be necessary to recompile the modules cudaArith.cu
        and cuda_cuda.c. A makefile for unix environment is provided. <br>
      </p>
      For CudaMat you will need&nbsp; <a
        href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html">NVidia's cuda
        library</a>&nbsp; installed on your operating system and a
      graphics card which can run cuda programs (above GeForce 8800).<br>
      This software is released under the GPL2 license. It can be used
      for non-commercial purposes.
      <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
      <p>CudaMat can be installed in two different ways. The easy way
        is, if there is no need to modify any cuda code. You can simply
        download the newest version of CudaMat and unzip it. It will
        contain a folder called "user64bitCuda6VC11" or similar.<br>
        This folder has to be copied to the temp file location as
        obtained by typing "tempdir" in you Matlab installation and
        renamed to "user". This directory will be user-specific.<br>
        Then only a Cuda Runtime library needs to be installed
        corresponding to the Cuda version in the filename and possibly
        C-runtime libraries corresponding to the C-version in the
        filename.<br>
      </p>
      <p>However, it should be noted, that this does not give you the
        capability of recompiling code or introducing user-defined cuda
        funtions. Thus you do not get the full benefit of CudaMat but
        should be able to run some fast code anyway.<br>

        SDK:</b> Visual Studio does not come with 64-bit compiler (not
      quite sure) and 64-bit libraries (for sure). You have to obtain

      provides the 64-bit libraries, headers, and the compiler. Ensure
      that 64-bit packages are selected when installing <span

      things to install, all available from <a

      drivers, <span class="il">CUDA</span> Toolkit, <span class="il">CUDA</span>
      SDK. Current version is 4.2<br>
      <br>
      <b>- Install CudaMat as described above</b>. To be able to use
      cudamat one needs to compile the custom library cudaArithmatic.obj
      (with nvcc) and the mex file cuda_cuda.mexw64 (with mex).
      Precomiled version might possibly work, but not guaranteed (due to
      mismatch of systems).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Configuration of mex and MatLab:</b><br>
      &gt; mex -setup<br>
      Works well iff VC++ and <span class="il">Windows</span> SDK are
      installed and the 64-bit compiler (cl.exe) is visible on the
      system PATH.<br>
      <br>
      If you have not installed and set up Cula you should add the
      following lines to your startup.m file:<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">addpath('/usr/local/CudaMat/');<br>
        initCuda();</span><br>
      <br>
      If you do not want to by default create ones (using "ones_cuda"),
      zeros (using "zeros_cuda"),&nbsp; you should change these places
      in the code by replacing the matlab function "ones" with
      "ones_cuda" and "zeros" with "zeros_cuda". See ones_cuda,
      zeros_cuda for more detail.<br>
      <br>
      The dipimage generator functions "newimage", "xx","yy","zz", "rr",
      "phiphi" are overwritten by CudaMat. By default they now generate
      cuda output. However this behaviour (and also of "ones_cuda" and
      "zeros_cuda") can invidually be controlled by the global
      variables:<br>
      use_zeros_cuda=1; use_ones_cuda=1; use_newim_cuda=1;
      use_newimar_cuda=1; use_xyz_cuda=1;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b> Configuration of nvcc:</b> <br>
      Trying to compile the cuda file (e.g. by going to the cuda
      directory and executing "applemantest(2)" you will get the error:<br>
      <div id=":ew"> nvcc fatal : Visual Studio configuration file
        '(null)' could not be found...."<br>
        This can be fixed by creating a file named <br>
        C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
        10.0\VC\bin\vcvars64.bat<br>
        with the only text in it:<br>

      <h2>History of CudaMat and Acknowledgements<br>
      </h2>
      CudaMat started with the incentive to write faster deconvolution
      software for microscopy image processing. Using the fft code
      provided by NVidia, it quickly became clear that something more
      general would be useful and the idea of CudaMat was born. CudaMat
      was written by Rainer Heintzmann with discussions and
      contributions from Martin Kielhorn, Kai Wicker, Wouter Caarls,
      Bernd Rieger and Keith Lidke.&nbsp;<br>

      <h2>Ongoing work / Future goals</h2>
      More standard Matlab and DipImage functions should be supported.
      E.g.: Mean, var, rand, median, wavelet transformations, rfft and
      convolve<br>
      Where possible DipImage code which does not use DipLib can be used
      directly from CudaMat. A number of in-place operations are planned
      to allow more efficient programs to be written. E.g. '<span
        style="font-style: italic;">+='</span> and alike should be
      implemented. These operations should also be implemented for
      standard Matlab and DipImage objects (for compatibility reasons).
      Even more special Multi-array operations could be useful.<br>
      A mechanism (via another datatype?) for parallelisation of Matlab
      loops could be introduced, which allows to profit from cuda even
      for operations involving small matrices).<br>
      Implement more Matlab and DipImage features in cuda. Most
      important are:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing the software on different systems and GPUs.<br>
        </li>
        <li>solving of equation systems. The current CUBLAS library
          unfortunately does not support this, as the Cholevski
          factorisation is not yet implemented. As soon as this changes
          equation system solving can be fully implemented in CudaMat.
          Currently the workaround is a conversion to standard matlab
          objects and back to cuda</li>
        <li>accessing elements via an index list should be implemented
          (e.g.<span style="font-style: italic;"> a=[3 5 7];b=[1 2 3 4 5
            6 7];b(a)</span>). Not yet finnished, but subsref_vec
          function exists</li>
        <li>automatic decision to move small vectors and matrices back
          to standard matlab objects. The CudaMat overhead for smaller
          objects can be quite significant, so a global variable (<span
            style="font-style: italic;">max_cuda_size</span>) might be
          useful to decide for automatic conversion back to standard
          matlab/DipImage.<br>
        </li>
        <li>a faster implementation of the<span style="font-style:
            italic;"> convolve</span> operation and full support of
          half-complex transforms (implementation of this is started but
          not yet finnished).</li>
        <li>Implement more variations of on-the-fly cuda commands.
          Different types of functions and macros.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
