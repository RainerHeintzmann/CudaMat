    <h1>On the fly CudaMat programming guide</h1>
    This guide describes the basic rule for constructing an on-the-fly
    cuda program.<br>
    On-the-fly programs can be of various types, depending on the type
    of function you want to implement.<br>
    Your code will go right into the core of the graphic card (and thus
    can easily crash it) but the matlab wrapper will deal with all the
    parameter conversion and data transport issues including calling the
    cuda function itself. Thus programming such a function is made
    really easy.<br>
    <h2>Function types</h2>
    The following function types currently exist and hopefully many more
    will be added later.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>CUDA_UnaryFkt&nbsp; : Takes one input array (refered to as
        "a") as input and has one output array (referred to as "c" in
        the cuda code).<br>
      </li>
      <li>CUDA_BinaryFkt&nbsp; : Takes two input arrays (refered to as
        "a" and "b") as inputs and has one output array (referred to as
        "c" in the cuda code).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    See also "help cuda_define"<br>
    <br>
    Write your program<br>
    In all code snippets you are writing a number of variables are
    predefined:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>idx&nbsp; : The linear index of your processor</li>
      <li>a,b,c : Depending on the function type (see above) input and
        output arrays</li>
      <li>sSize : A structure containing the source size array in its
        components s. E.g. sSize.s[1] would return the size along X<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you need to calculate with the position coordinates in the
    arrays, you can start your program with the line<br>
    CoordsNDFromIdx(idx,sSize)<br>
    wich will create the array "pos" assigning each processor directly
    the multidimensional coordinate of its pixel.<br>
    Furthermore the lines<br>
    int idd;IdxNDFromCoords(pos,sSize,idd)<br>
    will calculate the index corresponding to the position given in pos
    such that a result can for example be written to c[idd]=a[idx];<br>
